        <h3>Season Outlook</h3>
        <p>
            We knew coming into this season it was going to be one of the better seasons we've had in several years. We
            had the talent to compete with any team in our conference and the experience to go along with the talent. We didn't lose many seniors and had our entire core group of guys returning. Guys put in the work during the offseason and were ready to hit the ground running when practice rolled around!<br><br>
            Led by returning juniors Luke Schwartzhoff (12.7 ppg, 5.7 rpg) and Zach Todd (11.9 ppg, 4.3 rpg) we knew we had two of the best players in the conference that could match up with anyone. Add in senior leaders of Thomas Kiesau, Romy Whitford, and Grant Nutter we had all the pieces to be a special team.

        <h3>Season In Review</h3>
        <p>
            We started out the season strong winning the first four games, two against quality opponents in Rushford-Peterson and Rochester Lourdes. Through eight games we had a 7-1 record with the lone lose coming against a tough team in Onalaska. Then, as most seasons go, we hit a tough stretch where we lost four games in a row against teams we know we should have beat. On a positive side, I think it served as a wake up call for the guys, especially the seniors as we willed off 10 straight wins, including a road game against St. Charles, who we haven't beat in the last four years.<br><br>
            We were riding high going into our first matchup against rival Caledonia. It was another hard fought game, unfortunately we didn't have enough gas to hang with their talent and depth and took the loss. We were able to go 2-1 over the final 3 games and ended up with a 19-7 regular season record, securing the 4th seed in the sectional playoffs.<br><br>
            First playoff game was at home against Chatfield, a team that we beat by almost 20 early in the season. We knew it was going to be a better matchup as they were a team who made great improvement during the season. In another good game we were able to pull out the victory, 71-63. With the win, we advanced to the second round up in Rochester at the Mayo Civic Center in a matchup against Rochester Lourdes, a team we beat earlier in the year as well. We came out firing right from the tip, building a commanding double digit lead. Lourdes was able to creep their way back into the game, cutting it to single digits a couple times. However, we were always able to answer to hang onto the lead. Lead by Luke Schwartzhoff (24 points) and Zach Todd (18 points) we were able to seal the victory, 74-58. Next up, the one seed Lake City in the semifinals. We knew coming into the game we'd have to play solid defense on their two top players and also be able to capitalize on the offensive end by knocking down shots. While we were able to hold their top two players in check, the shots just weren't falling. We had opportunities in the second half to cut it within eight or fewer points, but we couldn't get shots to fall and they started making their shots and getting to the foul line. It just wasn't our night offensively and we ended up losing 43-61. Season over. There were a lot of emotions in the locker room as it sank in that our season was over. It was a heck of a season and one our guys can hold their heads high on as we finished 21-8 overall and made a good run in the playoffs.<br><br>
            Thomas Kiesau (8.1 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 4.8 apg), Zach Todd (15.3 ppg, 6.1 rpg), and Luke Schwartzhoff (16.3 ppg, 7.6 rpg) were selected to the all-conference team, the most players we've had selected in a season since we started coaching 4 years ago. Luke was also named to the <a href="https://lacrossetribune.com/sports/local/preps/all-tribune-boys-basketball-first-team-and-honorable-mention/article_04639633-d383-52b5-b948-110a64550635.html">La Crosse Tribune first team</a> while both Thomas and Zach were honorable mention. Overall, it was one of the most successfull and fun season La Crescent boy's have experienced in a long time. It was great to see the success the players had after putting in a lot of effort over the last several years. We're looking forward to next season and expect the same outcome!
